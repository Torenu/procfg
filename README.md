One and only best cfg file :D
===
Installation: paste into Steam\userdata\{userid}\730\local\cfg

Use exec {cfg_name} in game console to install any config file

gameplay.cfg and bhop.cfg are used separately to play regular match or bhop/kz server

interp.cfg can help with connection issues

**Binds**
---
mouse scroll - jump

c - lookatweapon

alt - voice chat

f, q - use flashbang or smoke (gotocheckpoint or save checkpoint on bhop.cfg)

mouse4, mouse5 - molly, hegrenade (not very good bind, better change it to keyboard keys)

x - bomb drop (changes to knife if you dont have bomb)

arrow keys - buy nades (except decoy)

Other keys are mostly default or are used for fun like chat spamming binds

Volvo plz return bomb finding feature with gameinstructor :(
